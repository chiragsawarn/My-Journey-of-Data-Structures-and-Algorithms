# Programs for Data Structures and Algorithms 🔢 💯 🕥 👍

## Introduction 📅
This repository consists of Data Structures and Algorithms I have learnt till date. Whatever I have included here is breifly described in below sections

## Sections

This Project Currently has 3 Sections : - 

### 1. Data Structures 🏬 which covers following concepts : 

* Arrays
* Linked List (Singly, Doubly and Circular)
* Stacks
* Queues
* Sorting Algorithms
* Hashing
* Trees : BST
* Heaps and Priority Queue
* Graphs 





### 2. Advanced Algorithms (More will be added soon)✡️
* Divide and Conquer
* Advanced Graph Algorithms 
* Greedy Algorithms
* Backtracking
... more to will be added soon


### 3. Project Euler 💠
These are mathematical problems from beginner to advanced. Solutions made by me are given here

## Tentative Additions ➕

1. CSE5 Problem Set
2. 450 Problem Set

## Contributions 🧮
